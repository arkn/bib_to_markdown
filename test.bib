  abstract     = {Causal reasoning is a crucial part of science and human
                  intelligence. In order to discover causal relationships from
                  data, we need structure discovery methods. We provide a review
                  of background theory and a survey of methods for structure
                  discovery. We primarily focus on modern, continuous
                  optimization methods, and provide reference to further
                  resources such as benchmark datasets and software packages.
                  Finally, we discuss the assumptive leap required to take us
                  from structure to causality.},
